# Sketch Workshop

## Why Sketch?
Sketch is a simple, focussed, interface design tool. It's interface is straight-forward, and in-line with OSX application conventions. It doesnt have more settings than you can remember, it works exclusively in vector, the only units are in pixels, it's tools work the same as CSS, and it's intuitive to use.

## Getting Started
In this workshop we'll be first familiarizing ourselves with the interface. Going through the following:
- The toolbars
- Understanding how vertices, layers and groups work
- The different editing modes
- Navigating and designing with the keyboard
- Layer styles, text styles, and symbols
- Plugins
- Exporting


1. If you dont have Sketch already, go to the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/sketch-3/id852320343?mt=12) and get the current production version.
